# Flappy Bird

This is a replica of the once famous game "Flappy bird" written in Java & Processing.  

I used the processing IDE to make this project (for no real reason).  
It was quite challenging to make the bird rotate as it moved up and down because of the way 
processing works, but I got it eventually (;


## How to Install and Run the Project

* Download and install [processing](https://processing.org/download).
* Download the ZIP file for the project from my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/oren9561/Flappy-Bird).  
* Launch the game and play
* If you want to review the code, launch the sketch through processing.

## How to play the game
### Keys

* Press space to jump.
* Press 'R' at any point to restart the game.

### How the game works

Simply make the bird jump through the gap between the pipes without hitting them.
There's no victory screen so the goal is basically just to get the highest score possible.

## Notes
* The collision mechanism in the game might look like it's not 100% accurate, but this is due to the high framerate - there's a small gap between the front to the back end so the user might see a collision when in actuality there wasn't one.
* Don't fly too close to the sun (;
